RaiderMath
==========

This is not the library you're looking for. Try [gl3n](https://github.com/Dav1dde/gl3n).

Still here? RaiderMath is a game math library. It exists solely to support RaiderEngine and is a little bit silly. It provides vectors and square matrices of dimensionality 2-4 and little else. It does not currently believe in swizzling, and thinks quaternions are a type of fruit.

If for some reason you want to use it, you are very welcome to.
